I spent a bit too much time putting together my basics, but things still came together

Flask
  -- simple and easy. love it
  -- lots of boilerplate, and i overdid it

Cassandra
  -- probably a mistake
    -- i like it and have used it before and it's pretty quick to setup
    -- can too many table migrations for quick feature dev
  -- worked well enough though!
  -- other sorting indexes would have been good to add

no frontend framework
  -- took too long with other stuff
  -- some small amount of jquery makes it reactive
  -- given more time and more data complexity, react as a view holder could be nice


The main feature is the autocomplete. It's ugly, but it takes a couple params and hits the api
Todo
  -- params should be in a form. make it easier to add to new ones
  -- by location

also better searching for users
